The project's main goal is to help researchers and conservationists to identify and classify animals in the wild, using a web application that allows them to upload images and get the classification results.</p><h3>Role</h3><p>Collaborated in the development of the web application's backend for camera trap image classification. My main role included generating and validating datasets with customer data, training several versions of the classification model to achieve optimal results, and developing the system's backend. The latter ranged from programming a database to building essential endpoints, exposed by APIs, such as user registration and authentication, project and photo management, and species reclassification. The system was implemented on a cloud server, prioritizing the cost benefit optimization of the server architecture.</p>",
